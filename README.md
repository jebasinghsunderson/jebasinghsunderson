# Hi there 🫡

### Personal detail :-
  My name is Jebasingh Sunderson I

  I like keeping things simple, sharp, and actually useful. I build, learn, and iterate fast — and I’m not afraid to refine something until it hits the mark. My work (and how I communicate) is all about clarity, intention, and making things better with each pass.

### What I’m working on
Crafting cleaner, smarter solutions — not bigger ones.
Improving my workflow by cutting out anything that doesn’t need to exist.

### Currently learning
Sharpening my skills one focused step at a time.
Finding the best ways to get more done with fewer words.

### Open to collaborating on
Projects that value precision, structure, and thoughtful design.
Anything where it involves machine learning is part of the fun, not a chore.

### 💬 Ask me about
Minimalist approaches to getting things done.
Refining ideas until they finally feel right.

### Pronouns
He/Him

### Fun fact
I can say more with one sentence than most people say in three paragraphs. Efficiency is a lifestyle.
